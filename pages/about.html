      <p id="bio">George Ruth is a soulful singer-songwriter born and raised in Humboldt County, CA. Their unique sound and heartfelt songs tells a story of who they are and where they come from. George started singing at age four in the Arcata Interfaith Gospel Choir, and started soloing there at age 7. Getting a whole crowd of people on their feet, dancing and clapping along, planted the seed for a love of performing in George. From then on, they performed wherever they could and learned any instrument they could. Their first instrument was the trumpet, which sparked their love of jazz. They would spend hours singing along to Ella Fitzgerald, attempting to match every note she sang and scatted, and then would play it on the trumpet. George was always singing and turning everything into a song. Around age 7, they started writing those songs down. Throughout their childhood they played the trumpet, saxophone and violin, as well as participating in the neighborhood bluegrass jams, but their voice was the main instrument that they were constantly honing.

        The summer they turned 15 they moved to Portland, Oregon with their mom and had a new found loneliness (and boredom) in this new place which led George to finally picking up the guitar. As soon as George could play G, C, and D chords, all the songs that were constantly floating in their head had a way of coming out. As they wrote more songs, they learned more chords to fit the melodies that were forming in their head.
        George spent countless hours listening and studying artists that they were drawn to. These were EmmyLou Harris, Allison Kraus, Gillian Welch, Ella Fitzgerald, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath to name a few. George focused on developing their voice through mimicking these different singers, but where they learned a majority of their technique was in their high school choir courses. In addition to the school choirs, they were selected to sing with the All State choir multiple years in a row, and they started an A cappella group with their friends. This led them to auditioning for a Collegiate A Capella group at University of Oregon in the spring of their senior year, and their acceptance into the group solidified their choice of college.
        After a year a UofO they decided to transfer schools to pursue their passion for horses. So with a cowboy hat, and a guitar strapped to their back, they got on a plane to Missouri for the first time to study Equestrian Science. This move only fueled their song writing fire, although a lot of songs now got written while mucking out stalls and working horses. They worked with horses in Missouri, Kentucky, Vermont, and Iowa and each place added a different flavor into their songwriting soup.
        They made their way back to their home state of California and a couple years later, in 2017, they released their first album “Life Worth Living” under the name Georgia Ruth, which was a culmination of songs they wrote from ages 19-24 telling stories of love and heartbreak of their journey into adulthood.
        As they’ve developed as a person, experienced becoming sober, and overcoming their own trials through life, they’ve solidified their own unique sound and song writing style that exudes their vulnerability, humor, empathy, and joy of life. Sharing their songs with people is one of their favorite things to do, which shines through every time they perform. </p>
